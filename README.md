# castro_speech
You have to create an presentation with many images and videos? A ten hours castro_speech, but with cats? Try castro_speech.js

Open presentation.html in your editor to include jQuery. I would recomend you to download a version, so you don't need an internet access.

After that create a directory where you put your Images and Videos.

Finally you can edit the json-object in slides.js.

Feel free to contribute, and to make it work in Chrome and Internet-Explorer.

Greetings,

Carlos
